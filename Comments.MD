# Implementation Details

- Successfully implemented all core functionality requested in the tasks
- Integrated with Strava API to fetch and display activities, detailed views, and lap analytics
- Added activity streams integration for heart rate, elevation, cadence, and speed metrics

### Technical Decisions

- Utilized `react-native-actions-sheet` library for modal displays to improve UX and maintain native feel
- Upgraded to Expo SDK 52 to enable physical device testing and improve development workflow
- Implemented proper error handling and loading states throughout the application

### Areas for Future Enhancement

- With more time, could implement more sophisticated data visualization for metrics
- Could add caching layer to improve performance and reduce API calls
- Potential to add offline support for previously loaded activities

### Learning Outcomes

- Gained valuable experience working with Strava's OAuth implementation and REST API
- Interesting challenge in processing and displaying complex activity stream data
- Good exercise in building a performant mobile interface for data-heavy applications

### Code Documentation

- Added inline comments throughout the codebase explaining key decisions and potential improvements
- Maintained clean code structure while meeting the 3-hour time constraint

This was an engaging project that provided good exposure to both the Strava API ecosystem and React Native development patterns.
